# Air Quality Analysis and AQI Prediction Using Machine Learning

This project aims to predict Air Quality Index (AQI) levels using real-time monitoring data and advanced machine learning models. By analyzing pollutants such as PM2.5, PM10, and Ozone, the model provides accurate insights into environmental health conditions, aiding decision-makers, researchers, and the public.
